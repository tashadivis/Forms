<!--Create a PHP Web Form with a single button, a textbox for the users’ name, a textbox for the users
email address, a larger textbox for user comments and a checkbox if they would like to be contacted. 
When the user inputs their information and presses the button, a new page will open thanking them for 
their input and displaying the time of input and all the information typed in from the start page. If the user 
had the checkbox selected, then display a message saying “You will be contacted in a week for your input” otherwise say “Your input will remain anonymous”.-->
